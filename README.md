# Revenue Optimization Project
A Data Analytics Project by Kwasi Dankwa

# 📌 Overview
This project investigates pricing strategies, discount trends, product categorization, and consumer engagement metrics for Adidas and Nike—two of the world’s leading sportswear brands for an online retail store. Through SQL data analysis and interactive Tableau visualizations, this study uncovers how these brands compete across pricing tiers, consumer reviews to optimize revenue performance.

# 📊 Key Questions Explored
* How do the average prices of Adidas and Nike compare?

* What pricing categories (Budget, Average, Expensive, Luxury) are dominant for each brand?

* How much discount is each brand offering on average?

* Is there a correlation between reviews and revenue?

* How does product description length relate to customer rating?

* Which months or periods show review volume gaps across brands?

* How do footwear and clothing products compare in terms of median revenue?

## Data Schema

![DB](images/db.png "DB diagram")
> All datasets are related through the product_id key, allowing for integrated analysis across brand, finance, reviews, and product details.

## Data Cleaning Process
To ensure consistency in product naming, I standardized the product_name field in the info_v2 table by converting all entries to uppercase. This helps avoid duplicate entries that differ only in casing and supports consistent labeling in visualizations.

<pre lang="markdown"> ``` 
  -- Updating `info_v2` table to have product_name values in uppercase 
  UPDATE info_v2 
  SET product_name = UPPER(product_name); 
  ``` </pre>
