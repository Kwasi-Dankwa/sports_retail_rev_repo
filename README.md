# Revenue Optimization Project
A Data Analytics Project by Kwasi Dankwa

# üìå Overview
As a product analyst at an online sports clothing company, my core objective is to identify tangible strategies for revenue growth. I will achieve this by conducting a deep dive into our product-level data, specifically analyzing pricing strategies, customer reviews and ratings, product descriptions, and website traffic patterns. The insights derived from this analysis will be translated into actionable recommendations for our marketing and sales teams to drive increased revenue

# üìä Key Questions Explored
* How do the average prices of Adidas and Nike compare?

* What pricing categories (Budget, Average, Expensive, Luxury) are dominant for each brand?

* How much discount is each brand offering on average?

* Is there a correlation between reviews and revenue?

* How does product description length relate to customer rating?

* Which months or periods show review volume gaps across brands?

* How do footwear and clothing products compare in terms of median revenue?

#  üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
SQL (SQLite) ‚Äì Data extraction, cleaning, CTEs, joins, aggregations, and correlation analysis

Tableau Public ‚Äì Interactive dashboard creation with charts, KPIs, and filtering capabilities

# üìÅ Datasets Used
[`Data Source`](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nickleejh/optimizing-online-sports-retail-revenue-using-sql/input)

brands_v2: Contains product and brand info (e.g., Adidas, Nike)

finance: Holds financial data such as listing price, sale price, revenue, and discount

reviews_v2: Contains review count and ratings

info_v2: Includes product descriptions

traffic_v3: Contains visit data for identifying consumer engagement patterns

## Data Schema

![DB](images/db.png "DB diagram")
> All datasets are related through the product_id key, allowing for integrated analysis across brand, finance, reviews, and product details.

## Data Cleaning Process
To ensure consistency in product naming, I standardized the product_name field in the info_v2 table by converting all entries to uppercase. This helps avoid duplicate entries that differ only in casing and supports consistent labeling in visualizations.

<pre lang="markdown"> ``` 
  -- Updating `info_v2` table to have product_name values in uppercase 
  UPDATE info_v2 
  SET product_name = UPPER(product_name); 
  ``` </pre>

## Pricing Insights

### Price Comparison (Nike v Adidas)

A Common Table Expression (CTE) named brand_price was used to calculate the average listing and sale prices for each brand by joining the brands_v2 and finance tables on product_id.
An INNER JOIN was used to ensure that only products with complete financial and branding information (i.e., present in both tables) were included in the analysis. This prevents null values and ensures the accuracy of the aggregated price metrics.

<pre><code>-
  - Calculate the average sale price difference between Adidas and Nike 
  WITH brand_price AS ( SELECT b.brand, AVG(f.listing_price) AS average_listing_price, 
  AVG(f.sale_price) AS average_sale_price 
  FROM brands_v2 b 
  INNER JOIN finance f ON b.product_id = f.product_id 
  WHERE b.brand IN ('Adidas', 'Nike') GROUP BY b.brand ) 
  SELECT 
  (SELECT average_sale_price FROM brand_price WHERE brand = 'Adidas') - (SELECT average_sale_price FROM brand_price WHERE brand = 'Nike') 
  AS price_difference_adidas_nike; 
</code></pre>

#### Adidas
* Adidas lists products at higher prices but sells at lower prices (approx. 34% discount).

* Adidas may be relying heavily on markdown strategies or promotions to drive sales.

* It also indicates overpricing at launch leading to inventory not moving without discounts.

#### Nike
Nike lists low but sells high, which could suggest:

* The listing price shown may reflect outdated or clearance inventory.
* Nike uses strategic upselling or bundling, or has premium products dominating sales.
* Consumers appear willing to pay more than listing, which is rare and noteworthy.
* Additionally, Nike products have no discounts attached to them.

### Product and Revenue Insights
This query was used to categorize products into price tiers and provides a breakdown of how each brand performs in those tiers in terms of product count and total revenue. It's useful for price segmentation analysis and understanding how revenue is distributed across pricing strategies.
<pre><code>-
-- Assessing Price Ranges --
SELECT b.brand, count(*) as num_of_products, sum(f.revenue) as total_revenue,
CASE WHEN listing_price < 32 THEN 'Budget'
     WHEN listing_price >= 32 AND listing_price < 74 THEN 'Average'
     WHEN listing_price >= 74 AND listing_price < 129 THEN 'Expensive'
     ELSE 'Luxury' END AS price_category
FROM finance f
INNER JOIN brands_v2 b
ON f.product_id = b.product_id
WHERE b.brand IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY brand, price_category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
</code></pre>
       

* Adidas Dominates Revenue
* Adidas has higher revenue across all price tiers (Average, Expensive, Luxury).
* Most revenue is concentrated in the Average tier ($3.86M from 1,214 items).
* Luxury Adidas also performs well ($3.01M), despite having fewer items (307), indicating strong revenue per product.

* Nike Has Lower Volume & Revenue
* Nike‚Äôs Budget tier drives the most revenue for the brand ($595K from 356 items).
* Luxury and Expensive tiers underperform, suggesting either lower pricing, weak positioning, or reduced consumer demand for high-end Nike items.

### Category
* Footwear Is the Clear Revenue Driver
* Footwear brings in ~92% of total revenue ($11.43M from 2,700 items).
* This suggests strong market demand, better margins, or wider product coverage in this category.

* Clothing Underperforms
* Clothing only accounts for $893K across 479 items.
* That‚Äôs less than 10% of footwear revenue, despite a decent product count ‚Äî possibly indicating lower average price or weaker consumer interest.

### Reviews and Revenue

This code creates to CTEs and uses Pearsons Correlation Coefficient to find out the relationship between number of reviews and revenue
<pre><code>-
--using cte to calculate correlation-- 
WITH CalcData AS (
    SELECT
        f.revenue,
        r.reviews
    FROM
        finance f
    INNER JOIN
        reviews_v2 r ON f.product_id = r.product_id
),
-- using pearsons correlation coefficient formula to find correlation
AggData AS (
    SELECT
        COUNT(revenue) AS N,
        SUM(revenue) AS SumRevenue,
        SUM(reviews) AS SumReviews,
        SUM(revenue * reviews) AS SumRevenueReviews,
        SUM(revenue * revenue) AS SumRevenueSq,
        SUM(reviews * reviews) AS SumReviewsSq
    FROM
        CalcData
)
SELECT
    (N * SumRevenueReviews - SumRevenue * SumReviews) /
    SQRT(
        (N * SumRevenueSq - SumRevenue * SumRevenue) *
        (N * SumReviewsSq - SumReviews * SumReviews)
    ) AS review_revenue_correlation
FROM
    AggData; 
    </code></pre>


There is a weak relationship between reviews and revenue (e.g., R¬≤ = 0.42) which means that customer review count only explains 42% of the variation in revenue. Additionally, Adidas products have had higher reviews than Nike products for a 2 year period(2018 - 2022)
Reasons for this could include:

* Reviews Are Not the Sole Driver of Sales - While more reviews may be correlated with higher sales, they are not a reliable standalone predictor, Products with fewer reviews can still perform well (e.g., if they‚Äôre marketed heavily or are premium items)

* Marketing, Brand, and Price May Matter More - Revenue likely depends more on brand perception, pricing strategy, product category, or promotional tactics than just review.

### Recommendations

1. The brand needs to explore opportunities to develop products in the ‚ÄúExpensive‚Äù and ‚ÄúElite‚Äù categories that have higher revenue potential.
2. Also, highest revenue generated Products are from footwear section, brand should focus on giving less discounts on footwear and more discounts on clothing that will increase sales and revenue for clothing section as well.
3. Continuously monitoring product section like footwear and clothing and making relevant price adjustments or marketing strategies.
4. Focusing on product quality, customer service, and holistic marketing strategies can help improve reviews and revenue.
5. Analyze factors that influence monthly review fluctuations and planning appropriate marketing strategies.
   
Using this data as a foundation to design more effective and customer-oriented business strategies. All of these recommendations can assist the brand in enhancing product performance, increasing revenue, and providing a better experience to customers.
